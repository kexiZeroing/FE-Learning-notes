# FE-Learning-notes

> This repo is only used for self learning, and many texts and example codes are copied from other places like MDN, Stackoverflow and Github.

- `I-know-nothing` is a collection of useful links/resources I want to put together.

- `demo/` are common FE concepts or basic components implemented in vanilla JS.

- `doc/` are markdown files for future reference which are not suitable to be placed in the `knowledge` directory.

- `doc/TIL.md` is organized and updated by bullet points with several sentences notes mostly for web development.

- `doc/FE_basic_notes` is the learning notes written in 2015 used for interview preparation at that time, which is in pure `.txt` format. It's written in Chinese and I want to keep it here for memory's sake, and this is the only Chinese document in this repo.

- `knowledge/` are classified and detailed documents used for learning or reviewing.
