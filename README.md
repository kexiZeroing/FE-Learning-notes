# FE-Learning-notes

> This repo is used for self learning. Some documents and examples are copied from other places like MDN, Stack Overflow and GitHub. The goal is to build a second brain.

- `link-collection.md` is a collection of useful links/resources I want to put together.

- `TIL.md` is organized and updated by bullet points with several sentences notes mostly for web development.

- `demo/` are common FE concepts or basic components implemented in vanilla JS.

- `knowledge/` are classified and detailed documents used for learning or reviewing.

- `doc/` are markdown files for future reference which are not suitable to be placed in the `knowledge/` directory.

- `doc/FE_basic_notes` is the learning notes written in the year of 2015 used for interview preparation at that time, which is in pure `.txt` format. It's written in Chinese and I want to keep it here for memory's sake, and this is the only Chinese document in this repo.

- `weekly-newsletter/` are collected from Twitter that I read every week and translated into Chinese. The content will be published to Wechat with pictures and stored here for the original text version.
