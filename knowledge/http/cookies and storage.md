## HTTP cookies
An HTTP cookie is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user's web browser. The browser may store it and send it back with later requests to the same server. Typically, it's used to tell if two requests came from the same browser â€” keeping a user logged-in, for example. It remembers stateful information for the stateless HTTP protocol.

After receiving an HTTP request, a server can send one or more `Set-Cookie` headers with the response. The cookie is stored by the browser, and then the cookie is sent with requests made to the same server inside a `Cookie` HTTP header. An expiration date or duration can be specified, after which the cookie is no longer sent. Additional restrictions to a specific domain and path can be set, limiting where the cookie is sent.

```
HTTP/2.0 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html
Set-Cookie: yummy_cookie=choco
Set-Cookie: tasty_cookie=strawberry

GET /sample_page.html HTTP/2.0
Host: www.example.org
Cookie: yummy_cookie=choco; tasty_cookie=strawberry
```

### Cookie restrictions
```
Set-Cookie: <cookie-name>=<cookie-value>; Domain=<domain-value>; Secure; HttpOnly

Set-Cookie: sessionId=38afes7a8
Set-Cookie: id=a3fWa; Expires=Wed, 21 Oct 2015 07:28:00 GMT
Set-Cookie: mykey=myvalue; SameSite=Strict
```

- Define the lifetime of a cookie  
The lifetime of a cookie can be defined in two ways:
  - **Session cookies** are deleted when the current session ends. (Some browsers have a session restore feature that will save all tabs and restore them next time the browser is used. Session cookies will also be restored, as if the browser was never closed, which can cause session cookies to last indefinitely long).
  - **Permanent cookies** are deleted at a date specified by the `Expires` attribute, or after a period of time specified by the `Max-Age` attribute. If both `Expires` and `Max-Age` are set, `Max-Age` has precedence.

- Restrict access to cookies  
A cookie with the `Secure` attribute is sent to the server only over the HTTPS protocol, never with unsecured HTTP (except on localhost). Insecure sites `http:` cannot set cookies with the `Secure` attribute. A cookie with the `HttpOnly` attribute is inaccessible to the JavaScript `document.cookie` API; it is sent only to the server.

  Note that normally localhost should be treated as a secure origin even if not HTTPs. Both Chrome (https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=1056543) and Firefox (https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1648993) fixed issues to allow secure cookies for localhost. The `https:` requirements are ignored when the `Secure` attribute is set by localhost since Firefox 75 and Chrome 89.

- Define where cookies are sent  
The `Domain` attribute specifies which hosts are allowed to receive the cookie. If unspecified, defaults to the host of the current document URL, **not including subdomains**. If `Domain` is specified, then **subdomains are always included**. Therefore, specifying `Domain` is less restrictive than omitting it. However, it can be helpful when subdomains need to share information about a user.

  The `Path` attribute indicates a URL path that must exist in the requested URL in order to send the Cookie. For example, if `Path=/docs` is set, `/docs`, `/docs/Web/`, `/docs/Web/HTTP` are all matched.

- SameSite cookies  
The `SameSite` attribute lets servers require that a cookie shouldn't be sent with cross-origin requests. It takes three possible values: `Strict`, `Lax`, and `None`. With `Strict`, the cookie is sent only to the same site as the one that originated it, which **completely blocks a cookie being sent to `a.com` when a page from `b.com` makes the request**. `Lax` is similar, with an exception for when the user navigates to a URL from an external site, such as by following a link. `None` has no restrictions on cross-site requests.

  Browsers are migrating to have cookies **default to `SameSite=Lax`**. (While you could rely on modern browsers to apply `SameSite=Lax` automatically, you should rather specify it explicitly tell which SameSite policy applies to your cookie). If a cookie is needed to be sent cross-origin, opt out of the SameSite restriction by using the `None` directive. **The `None` directive requires that the `Secure` attribute also be used**.

### Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks
These attacks are possible because web browsers send authentication tokens automatically with every request to the server. It takes advantage of the user's previously authenticated session. An example of a CSRF attack:

1. A user signs into `www.good-banking-site.com`. The server authenticates the user and issues a response that includes an authentication cookie. The site is vulnerable to attack because it trusts any request that it receives with a valid authentication cookie.
2. The user visits a malicious site `www.bad-crook-site.com`. It contains an HTML form similar to the following:
    ```html
    <h1>Congratulations! You're a Winner!</h1>
    <form action="http://good-banking-site.com/api/account" method="post">
        <input type="hidden" name="Transaction" value="withdraw">
        <input type="hidden" name="Amount" value="1000000">
        <input type="submit" value="Click to collect your prize!">
    </form>
    ```
3. The user clicks the submit button. The browser makes the request and automatically includes the authentication cookie for the requested domain `www.good-banking-site.com`. The server has the user's authentication context and can perform any action that an authenticated user is allowed to perform.

**How to prevent CSRF**
- Use sameSite Cookie
- Determine the origin of the request is coming from. It can be done via `Origin` or `Referer` header.
- Include a CSRF token as a hidden field when the form is submitted. This token is a unique, secret, unpredictable value generated by the server-side and transmitted to the client in such a way that it is included in a subsequent HTTP request made by the client.


## sessionStorage and localStorage
Cookies were once used for client-side storage, but it is now recommended to use modern storage APIs. Invoking Web Storage API will create an instance of the `Storage` object, through which data items can be set, retrieved, and removed. A different `Storage` object is used for the `sessionStorage` and `localStorage` for each origin.

- A page session lasts as long as the browser is open, and **survives over page reloads and restores**. (same page/tab && same origin)
- Opening multiple tabs/windows with the same URL creates `sessionStorage` for each tab/window.
- Closing a tab/window ends the session and clears objects in `sessionStorage`.
- Data stored in `localStorage` has no expiration time.

```javascript
Storage.length;
Storage.setItem(keyName, keyValue);
Storage.getItem(keyName);
Storage.removeItem(keyName);
Storage.clear();
```
