## 定期搬运新鲜事儿 2023-01-08

这是『定期搬运新鲜事儿』的第三十一篇。到年终总结的时候，会看到一些年度词云图，这里简要说一下它背后的生成方法。第一步是定时抓取热搜数据，比如我们建一个 GitHub 仓库专门做这件事情，请求知乎的这个接口 `https://www.zhihu.com/api/v4/search/top_search`，拿到数据后写入文件 `raw/zhihu-search/2023-01-01.md` 存档保留。这里注意如果每天多次抓取数据，需要先读文件并在再次写入时去重。当这个流程跑通后，下一步就是将手动收集数据变为自动，利用 GitHub workflows 创建一个定时任务 [.github/workflows/schedule.yml](https://github.com/huqi-pr/trending-in-one/blob/master/.github/workflows/schedule.yml) 来执行数据抓取的操作，比如设置 `cron: "0 * * * *"` 表示每小时执行一次 *(every minute 0, any hour and day)*。任务的最后是 git push 提交会触发常规的 CI 流程，比如跑测试等。整个流程全部自动化，不需要人为干预。生成词云我们写 Python 脚本，要依次读文件收集对应的文本，然后用 [jieba](https://github.com/fxsjy/jieba) 做分词并统计词频，最后调用 pyecharts 的词云展示方法进行 html 生成。当然也可以把分词的结果返回前端，由前端生成词云。

2. 2022 年的 12 Days of Web (https://12daysofweb.dev) 已经完结，再加上 2021 年的十二个主题 https://12daysofweb.dev/2021, 可以学习到很多原生的 Web 知识，是非常好的 Web 学习技术资料。

3. 如果你有从在浏览器里播放的视频中快速抓取一帧画面的需求，可以使用下面的方案，它会打开一个新的页面展示视频当前时刻的截图画面。

```js
const v = document.querySelector('video')
let c = document.createElement('canvas')
c.height = v.videoHeight || parseInt(v.style.height)
c.width = v.videoWidth || parseInt(v.style.width)
const ctx = c.getContext('2d')
ctx.drawImage(v, 0, 0)
const wnd = window.open('')
wnd.document.write(`<img src="${c.toDataURL()}"/>`)
```

Note that the html video needs to have `crossorigin="anonymous"` (that is, allow non-authenticated downloading of the video cross-origin). The pixels in a canvas's bitmap can come from a variety of sources, including images or videos retrieved from other hosts. As soon as you draw into a canvas any data that was loaded from another origin without CORS approval, the canvas becomes tainted. A tainted canvas is one which is no longer considered secure, and any attempts to retrieve image data back from the canvas will cause an exception to be thrown.

4. 有些登录系统需要双重认证 Two-factor authentication（又称两步骤验证，要求用户同时提供两种不同类型的凭据来确定其身份，比如用户名/密码加上手机上的一个动态认证码），那在 e2e 测试中如何完成这样的验证过程呢？具体看 https://blog.checklyhq.com/how-to-bypass-totp-based-2fa-login-flows-with-playwright 
   - Following the flow, people log in with their credentials and are prompted with another confirmation dialog — the second factor. After receiving and entering the second-factor passcode, they can confirm that they really are the person they claim to be and access their account.
   - Time-based one-time password (TOTP) is a computer algorithm that generates a one-time password (OTP) that uses the current time as a source of uniqueness. The OTP is valid only for a short period, usually 30 seconds.
   - In GitHub’s 2FA flow, the displayed QR code encodes the following information: `otpauth://totp/GitHub:USERNAME?secret=SECRET&issuer=GitHub`, and the secret is paired with the current time to generate a one-time password in a TOTP flow.
   - [OTP Auth library](https://www.npmjs.com/package/otpauth) is a good choice that provides all the functionality to generate one-time passwords.

5. https://mafs.dev 是一个 React 展示数学坐标系和图像的库，元素还可以交互，比如下面是一个显示 `Math.sin(x)` 和过两点画一条直线的例子。

```js
import { Mafs, CartesianCoordinates, FunctionGraph } from "mafs"

function HelloFx() {
  return (
    <Mafs>
      <CartesianCoordinates subdivisions={4} />
      <FunctionGraph.OfX y={(x) => Math.sin(x)} />
    </Mafs>
  )
}
```

```js
import { Mafs, Line, CartesianCoordinates, useMovablePoint } from "mafs"

function LineThroughPointsExample() {
  const point1 = useMovablePoint([-1, -1])
  const point2 = useMovablePoint([2, 1])

  return (
    <Mafs>
      <CartesianCoordinates />
      <Line.ThroughPoints
        point1={point1.point}
        point2={point2.point}
      />
      {point1.element}
      {point2.element}
    </Mafs>
  )
}
```
