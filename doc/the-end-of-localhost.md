### Gitpod
https://www.gitpod.io/

From a Git Repository on GitHub, Gitlab or Bitbucket, Gitpod can spin up a server-side-dev-environment for you in seconds (prefixing its URL with `gitpod.io/#`). That's a docker container that you can fully customize and that includes your source code, git-Terminal, VS Code extensions, your IDE, etc. The dev environment is enough powerful to run your app and even side-services like databases.

This is easily repeatable and reproducible because it's automated and version-controlled and shared across the team. We call this dev-environment-as-code. Sending a snapshot of your dev environment to a colleague is as easy as sending a URL.

Your workplace is already compiled and all dependencies of your code have been downloaded. In order to tell Gitpod how to prepare a dev environment for your project, check in a `.gitpod.yml` file into the root of the repository.

### Brev.dev

Brev creates your powerful computer in the cloud for development. Brev solves configurations with the `.brev` directory. Create your `.brev/setup.sh` script to make your environment reproducible. Brev will automatically run it when creating the workspace.
