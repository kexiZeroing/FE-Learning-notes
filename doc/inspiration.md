## Resources make me feel better
Sometimes I feel tired and get lost in the technology ocean. Web development is a big word today, not to mention computer science, and it has many related branches which also could have a deep path. When I start to do something by myself and meet difficulties that are not easily solved, it seems I can't do anything and I don't really understand anything. That's a terrible feeling and will cause anxiety even totally lost in my career path.

I admit that I'm not a typical geek who is so smart and addicted to the coding. The curiosity, job, and long-time habit drives me to keep living as a developer which means I need to learn all the time and the bad thing is I need to learn again and again since I would forget what I have learned before. I need to spend a long time doing actual work and solving issues to truly master a skill, to be more specific, reading documents, learning from blogs/videos with taking notes, and using them in everyday work.

I should remember what I have and lower the expectations. Take a relief, I'm just a normal person who wants to be happy, make money, and not feel a void. No one can know everything. You don't need to learn and acquire every aspect, so just keep going at your pace. Furthermore, learning is not a direct and straight way. Interest, energy, time, and results are always fluctuating along with you.

Becoming a good engineer is about collecting experience. Each project, even small ones, is a chance to add new techniques and tools to your toolbox. To experience is to learn.

Write about what you learn. It pushes you to understand topics better. Sometimes the gaps in your knowledge only become clear when you try explaining things to others. It's OK if no one reads what you write. You get a lot out of just doing it for you.

## Business and Engineering alignment by Kent C. Dodds
Your job isn't to turn user stories into code. The company has a mission. Everyone at the company is hired to push that mission forward. You're not a software engineer hired to code. You're a human hired to push their mission forward. It just so happens that you are a human with coding skills and during the hiring process, they recognized that those coding skills could help them in their mission.

You may not have enough information to perform the analysis. You may need to ask the product manager questions about the features and how they tie into the mission of the company. Go into the conversation with an open mind and a desire to understand. The company hired the product manager to help prioritize work in the optimal way to push the mission forward. You should trust them to do their job well and recognize that they may have context that you're missing. So long as you effectively expressed all the information you can about the long-term benefit-to-effort ratio of your ideas then you've done all you can there.
