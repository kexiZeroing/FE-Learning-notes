1. **major.minor.patch** version (also known as **breaking.feature.fix**): `^` instructs npm to install the newest version of the package with the same major version; Use `~` to have both the major and minor version match.
2. `__dirname` and `__filename`: running `node example.js` from `/Users/mjr`, **__dirname** is `/Users/mjr` and **__filename** is `/Users/mjr/example.js`
3. Passing arguments to other npm commands, we can leverage the `--` separator. e.g. `"pass-flags-to-other-script": "npm run my-script -- --watch"` will pass the `--watch` flag to the `my-script` command.
4. Quickly browse the history of a file in the repo: Go to a file in GitHub, replace `github.com` with `github.githistory.xyz` (i.e. https://github.githistory.xyz/kexiZeroing/FE-Learning-notes/blob/master/README.md)
5. `Cmd + Shift + .` toggles hidden files in Mac.
6. After `Cmd + h` to hide the window, there is no shortcut to bring the window back, **because the app loses focus when hidden**. The easiest way to do is using task switcher `Cmd + Tab` to display it normally.
7. Open VS Code in terminal: `Cmd + Shift + p` -> type **Shell Command: Install 'code' command in PATH** -> restart the terminal for the new `$PATH` value to take effect, and type `code .` to open VS Code. (`open .` to open the Finder)
8. Drag the file tab from VS Code into the terminal to get the absolute path for that file.
9. Browser notepad: `data:text/html,<html contenteditable>`
10. Ever struggled with some forgotten processes taking over a port you're trying to use? Just run `npx kill-port [port-number]`
11. Type `printenv` in the terminal to list all the default environment variables.
12. Install tldr pages `npm install -g tldr` which simplify the `man pages` with practical examples, e.g. try to run `tldr tar` or `tldr git branch`.
13. Short link `react.new`, `vue.new`, `ng.new`, `js.new`, `csb.new` to create a new codeSandbox project.
14. Use `if (typeof window === 'undefined')` to execute code only in the server-side. We can’t do it using `if (window === undefined)` because we’d get a “window is not defined” runtime error.
15. `du` command is used to display disk usage statistics. It calculate and print the disk space used by files or directories. `du -ah` (`-a` means display an entry for each file; `-h` for human-readable output).
16. Underneath the file system, files are represented by inodes. **A file in the file system is basically a link to an inode**. When you delete a file, it removes the link to the underlying inode. The inode is only deleted when all links to the inode have been deleted. 
17. A **hard link** (`ln <source> <target>`) creates another file with a link to the same underlying inode. If the real copy is deleted, the link still works, because it accesses the underlying data which the real copy was accessing. A **symbolic link** (`ln -s <source> <target>`) is a link to another name in the file system. It is something like a shortcut in Windows. If the real copy is deleted, the link will not work.
18. You can set the parameters of the function passed to setInterval and setTimeout by specifying extra arguments in the call, e.g. `setTimeout(console.log, 1000, 'hello');`
19. Scroll the window to a particular place in the document, `window.scroll({top: 100, left: 100, behavior: 'smooth'});` or setting in CSS `html { scroll-behavior: smooth; }`
20. Conditionally add a member to an object: `const item = {... true && {bar: 'bar'}, ... false && {falsy: 'falsy'}};`, and the item will be `{bar: "bar"}`
21. A **daemon** is a background, non-interactive program. It is detached from the keyboard and display of any interactive user. The word daemon for denoting a background program is from the Unix culture.
22. **Difference between ./ and source:** `./myscript` will execute the script provided that the file is executable (or start with a shebang line) and located in the current directory. It will run the commands in a new shell process. `. myscript` will run the commands in the current shell and is the same as `source myscript` (source is a synonym for dot).
23. **Difference between sh and source:** When you call `sh`, you initiate a fork (sub-process) that runs a new session of `/bin/sh`, which is usually a symbolic link to bash. If you launch it using `./test.sh`, the first line `#!/bin/sh` would be detected, then it would be exactly the same as `sh ./test.sh`. It executes shell scripts in a new shell process, so any variables which are assigned disappear after the script is done.
24. **GNU** (GNU's Not Unix) is a collection of tools which help to create a fully functional operating system. GNU's goal was to create a fully free, open source replacement of Unix. **Linux functions as an operating system kernel but the Linux kernel alone does not form a working operating system**. When Linux was created, there were many GNU components already created but GNU lacked a kernel, so Linux was used with GNU components to create a complete operating system. We prefer to use the term **“GNU/Linux”** to refer to systems that many people casually refer to as “Linux”.
25. All shells originate from the Bourne Shell, called `sh`. **Bash** means Bourne Again SHell. `sh` was proprietary and not open source, but Bash is created as a free alternative for the GNU project. It offers functional improvements over `sh` for both programming and interactive use.
26. The `void` operator evaluates the given expression and then returns undefined. It is **often used merely to obtain the undefined primitive value**, usually using `void(0)` (which is equivalent to `void 0`). Arrow functions with a short-hand braceless syntax will return an expression. This can cause unintended side effects by returning the result of a function that previously returned nothing. To be safe, when the return value is not intended to be used, it can be passed to the void operator.
27. **Regular polling** periodically sends a request to the server like asking “Hey do you have any new information for me?”. **Long polling** is similar, but after a request to the server, the connection hangs and the server will only close the connection with a response once there’s new information. **WebSocket** enables two-way communication, and after the connection is opened, the client can send messages to the server and receive event-driven responses without having to poll the server for a reply. **Socket.IO** enables real-time, bidirectional and event-based communication. It tries to establish a WebSocket connection if possible, but will fall back to HTTP long polling if not.
