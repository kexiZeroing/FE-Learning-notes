## Resources make me feel better

Sometimes I feel tired and get lost in the technology ocean. Web development is a big word today, not to mention computer science, and it has many related branches which also could have a deep path. When I start to do something by myself and meet difficulties that are not easily solved, it seems I can't do anything and I don't really understand anything. That's a terrible feeling and causee anxiety even totally lost in my career path.

I admit I'm not a geek who is so smart and addicted to the coding. The curious, job, and long-time habit drives me to keep living as a developer which means I need to learn all the time and the bad thing is I need to learn again and again since I would forget what I learned before. I need to spend a long time doing actual work and solving issues to truly master a skill, to be more specific, reading the documents, learning from blogs/videos with taking notes, and using them in everyday work.

However, I can remember what I have and lower expectations. Take a relief, I'm just a normal person who wants to happy, make money, and not feel a void. No one can do anything. You don't need to learn and acquire every aspect, just keep going at your pace. Furthermore, learning is not a direct and straight way. Interest, energy, time, and results are always fluctuating along with you.
